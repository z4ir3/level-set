**The Level-Set method** 

The **Level-Set** (LS) method is a very versatile and extensible method for tracking 
propagating interfaces in a wide variety of settings, such as burning flames, 
ocean waves, and material boundaries.

The method has been firstly introduced by **Osher and Sethian** in 1988 for tracking the 
curvature-dependent evolving interfaces in the setting of **Hamilton-Jacobi equations**.

This repository shows an example of the level set method 
for tracking the evolving fronts under the mean **curvature**.
